# Miles Driven Calculator

## Week 2 Assignment 3_5 - NECC
## Professor Ethel Schuster
## Student Patricia Antlitz

### This program takes user input using built-in function scanf from the stdio library.  -

##### User interactions:
- Asks for miles driven daily.
- Asks for the current cost of the gallon of gas.
- Asks for the car's average miles per gallon.
- Asks for amount paid in parking daily.
- Asks for amount paid in tolls daily.


This program allows a user to interact with the CLI by inputing responses to the questions printed.
It calculates the avarage daily cost of driving a car taking into consideration the miles driven, the cost of the gallon, the car's miles per gallon, the parking fee and the toll. User is to enter the values and the program will calculate based on that.

the results will print in dollar and cents format

I did not encouter any difficulties while developing this program, except by remembering possible formulas to calculate avarages at 3:28 AM, once I did remember, the program was easy to develop.
